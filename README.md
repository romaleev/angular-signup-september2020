# Angular Signup September 2020

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.1.

## Task

* Build a single page app with a sign-up form.
* The form should allow users to enter first name, last name, email, and password.
* All fields are required.
* Password validation:
    * Should be a minimum of eight characters,
    * Should contain lower and uppercase letters,
    * Should not contain userâ€™s first or last name.
* Email should be validated but there are various ways of accomplishing this. So, show us what
you consider as a proper email validation.
* The form should send a POST request to https://demo-api.now.sh/users. The request body
example:
```
{
    firstName: "Thomas",
    lastName: "Shelby",
    email: "thomas@shelby.co.uk"
}
```
